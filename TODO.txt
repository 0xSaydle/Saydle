TODO: Check Onboarding Flow Criteria

1. Phone Number to Subscription Flow
   - Verify that users with phone numbers are properly redirected
   - Ensure users can't access onboarding after completing phone verification
   - Check if subscription step is properly integrated after phone verification
   - Validate that all user data (phone, name, etc.) is saved before subscription

2. Database Updates
   - Confirm that user data is properly updated in the database
   - Verify that subscription status is correctly set
   - Check if all required fields are populated

3. Session Management
   - Ensure session is updated with latest user data
   - Verify that subscription status is reflected in the session
   - Check if user state is properly maintained throughout the flow

4. Edge Cases
   - Test what happens if user leaves during onboarding
   - Verify behavior when user returns after partial completion
   - Check handling of failed subscription attempts

5. Middleware Improvements
   - Improve the middleware redirection logic for step 5 access
   - Implement a more robust solution for handling onboarding completion
   - Consider using a dedicated "onboarding_completed" flag instead of checking phone_number
